# Apollo
Have you ever heard of Zork and wondered "Man, I'd love to make my own oldschool text-based interactive novel, but it's toooo much work!"? Well, say no more!

Apollo is an easy to use interactive novel creator and player, easy and powerful at the same time!

## What can I use now?
Well, main app isn't even in aplha yet, but you can play with the Editor!
